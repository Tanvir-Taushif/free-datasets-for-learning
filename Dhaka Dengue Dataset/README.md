# Dengue Dataset of Bangladesh  

## Overview  

This dataset contains **real-world data** collected through surveys in the **Dhaka region of Bangladesh** to analyze the prevalence and characteristics of **Dengue fever**. Given the **recurring Dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh**, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for **public health research, monitoring, and intervention planning**.  

## **Context**  

Dengue is a **vector-borne disease** transmitted by the **Aedes mosquito** and has been a **major health concern in Bangladesh**, particularly in **Dhaka**. With seasonal outbreaks affecting thousands, data-driven approaches can help identify **patterns, risk factors, and high-risk areas** for better decision-making.  

This dataset is **updated monthly** to reflect the **latest trends** in Dengue infections.

## **Dataset Description**  

The dataset consists of **several key features** to analyze Dengue infection patterns:  

| Column Name  | Description  |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Gender**  | Gender of the survey respondent (`Male` / `Female`).  |
| **Age**  | Age of the respondent.  |
| **NS1**  | NS1 antigen test result (`1 = Positive`, `0 = Negative`).  |
| **IgG**  | IgG antibody test result (`1 = Positive`, `0 = Negative`).  |
| **IgM**  | IgM antibody test result (`1 = Positive`, `0 = Negative`).  |
| **Area**  | The area within Dhaka where the respondent resides.  |
| **Area Type**  | Classification as **"Developed"** or **"Undeveloped"** based on infrastructure.  |
| **House Type**  | Type of residence: **"Building"**, **"Tin-Shed"**, or **"Others"**.  |
| **District**  | The specific **district** within Dhaka.  |
| **Outcome**  | **Dengue infection status** (`1 = Positive`, `0 = Negative`).  |
