# Dhaka Traffic Patterns Dataset

Welcome to the **Dhaka Traffic Patterns Dataset**! This dataset provides demo data that simulates real-life traffic patterns in Dhaka, Bangladesh, designed for learning and practice purposes. The data follows real-life trends but is not based on actual traffic data.

## Dataset Overview

The **Dhaka Traffic Patterns Dataset** contains traffic data for various locations in Dhaka, focusing on vehicle counts, weather conditions, road types, and congestion levels over a period of time. This dataset is ideal for data analysis, machine learning practice, and data visualization projects.

### **Dataset Details:**
- **Total Rows:** 981 rows per CSV file (for each week).
- **Fields/Columns:**
  - **Date:** The date of the traffic observation (e.g., 2024-01-01).
  - **Day of the Week:** The day of the week for the given date (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
  - **Location:** The location in Dhaka where the data was collected (e.g., Mirpur, Gulshan).
  - **Time Group:** The time group during which the data was collected (e.g., Morning Rush, Evening Rush).
  - **Vehicle Count:** The total number of vehicles counted during the time group.
  - **Weather Conditions:** The weather conditions during the time group (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy).
  - **Road Type:** The type of road where the data was collected (e.g., Highway, Arterial Road, Residential Street).
  - **Congestion Level:** The congestion level at the location during the time group (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

### **Important Note:**
This dataset contains **demo data** that follows real-life trends and patterns. It is **not real data** and should be used for learning, practicing data analysis, and testing machine learning models. The data is designed to simulate realistic traffic patterns and behaviors in Dhaka but does not represent actual traffic observations.

## Purpose of the Dataset:
- **Traffic Analysis:** Analyze traffic behavior, peak hours, and congestion patterns across different locations and times of the day.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build machine learning models to predict traffic congestion levels and vehicle counts based on time, weather, and road type.
- **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to better understand traffic trends, congestion levels, and weather impacts on traffic flow.

## How to Use This Dataset

1. **Download the dataset:** Download the CSV files containing traffic data for each week.
2. **Data Exploration:** Use the dataset to explore traffic patterns, peak traffic times, and congestion levels.
3. **Machine Learning Applications:** Apply machine learning algorithms to predict future traffic congestion or analyze factors influencing traffic flow.
4. **Visualization:** Use tools like Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau, or Power BI to create interactive visualizations and gain insights from the data.

## Example Use Cases

- **Traffic Pattern Analysis:** Identify peak traffic hours and locations with the highest congestion.
- **Weather Impact on Traffic:** Investigate how different weather conditions (rain, sun, etc.) affect traffic congestion.
- **Time-based Analysis:** Analyze traffic trends on weekdays vs weekends, and across different times of the day.
