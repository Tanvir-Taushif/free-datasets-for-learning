# Open Datasets for Data Analysis Practice

Welcome to my collection of open datasets! This repository is a result of my passion for learning data analysis and sharing the knowledge with others. The datasets here are created for practice and educational purposes. While they do not contain real data, they follow real-life patterns to provide a realistic foundation for your analysis projects.

## Motivation

When I started learning data analysis, I found a significant scarcity of diverse datasets. Free datasets are not always easy to find, and this makes it challenging for apprentice data professionals to practice and improve their skills. I felt the need for a free, accessible source that provides various types of datasets, allowing learners to perform different kinds of analysis. 

These datasets are modified to follow real-life patterns, and they are designed to be helpful for learning different techniques and using various tools for analysis. By sharing these datasets, I hope to make it easier for others to practice, experiment, and grow in their data analysis journey.


## Datasets

Here is a description of the available datasets:

| Dataset Name            | Description                                          | Data Type       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **[Dhaka Traffic Dataset](./Dhaka%20Traffic%20Dataset/)** | A demo dataset containing traffic data from Dhaka city, following real-life patterns. | CSV, JSON       |
| **[Dream Supershop Dataset](./Dream%20Supershop%20Dataset/)** | A demo dataset simulating customer, product, and sales data for a fictional retail business. | Excel |

Each dataset is designed to be a useful resource for practicing various data analysis techniques, from basic exploration to advanced machine learning applications.

## How to Use

1. Browse through the available datasets in this repository.
