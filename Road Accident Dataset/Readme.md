## Usage

This dataset can be used for various purposes such as:

- **Predictive Modeling:** Build models to predict accident severity or identify high-risk road conditions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Gain insights into accident patterns based on weather, road type, etc.
- **Policy Making:** Assist local authorities in implementing safety measures.

## Example Use Case

Hereâ€™s a sample use case:

1. **Analyze Accident Frequency by Day:** Identify the most common days for accidents to occur.
2. **Assess Severity by Road Type:** Determine which road types are more prone to serious accidents.
3. **Visualize Geospatial Data:** Map accident locations to find high-risk areas.
